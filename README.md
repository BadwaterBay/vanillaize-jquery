## Description

This app helps you convert jQuery selectors to vanilla JavaScript.

Once upon a time, jQuery offers great convenience to JavaScript developers. However, now vanilla JavaScript can do much more. More often than you think, you don't need jQuery. Using vanilla JavaScript is more than enough.

Removing jQuery dependency means your web app can run faster and be loaded faster. It also makes it easier when you migrate your existing web app to more modern libraries or frameworks, such as React/Redux.
